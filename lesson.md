# tidyverse-intro-module

## Overview

This module uses a multi-year dataset of water quality variables that have been measured at drinking water reservoirs in the Roanoke, VA region.  It focuses on comparing how water temperature and chlorophyll-a, both associated with water quality, vary across time and among reservoirs.  The assignment is designed to help you review R tidyverse skills that have been introduced to prior to the course.  It specifically provides links to the relevant sections in the excellent [R for Data Science book (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.  The links allow for self-guided review of the material.

## Questions

- How does water temperature and chlorophyll-a vary across drinking water reservoirs in the Roanoke, VA region?
- How do we read and plot this data in a scriptable & reproducible manner?
- How do we communicate technical analysis in notebook formats that combine code, text, and visuals?

## Objectives

  - Review coding skills learned in pre-requisite courses by analyzing a real environmental dataset
  - Learn skills in summarizing and wrangling multi-location temporal data
  - Demonstrate ability to use RStudio, GitHub, and Quarto to demonstrate reproducible output.
  - Demonstrate ability to communicate clearly in code, written text, and visual formats.

## Requirements:

  - `tidyverse`
  - `R`
  - RStudio
  - Git & GitHub.

## Instructions

  - Open the notebook `assignment/tidyverse-intro.qmd` in RStudio
  - Work through the exercises described in the notebook.
  - Render + commit output files to GitHub

## Context

This module has been developed as the second module in a junior-level Environmental Data Science course at Virginia Tech.  The course is require for majors in the Environmental Data Science degree.  The course has a pre-requisite course that introduces students to tidyverse concepts.  It assumes that students have set of Git and GitHub and understand how to commit and push through Rstudio.

## Timeframe

2-weeks (4 75-minute class periods are allocated to this module) at the beginning of the course.

## Background Reading, Video & Exercises

The background reading is embedded in the assignment Rmarkdown as links to the relevant sections of [R for Data Science book (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.
