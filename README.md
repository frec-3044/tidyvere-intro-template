This repository is a template for every teams introduction to tidyverse repository. This is the second module of FREC 3044 Environmental Data Science, intended to provide a review of tidyverse skills learned in prior courses.

## assignment

All work for this assignment is in the `assignment` directory.  Code is contained in the `tidyverse-intro.Rmd` notebook, and final rendered output files (`tidyverse-intro.md` and associated files) are in the `assignment` directory as well. The general rubric you will be graded on is found in the `rubric.md` file. 

## Special files

Additionally this repository, and all team repositories, includes most of the special files found here:

### Common files

- `README.md` this file, a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `lesson.md` a description of the assignment.
- `.gitignore` Optional file, ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this. 
- `tidyverse-intro.Rproj` an R-Project file created by RStudio for it's own configuration of the repo files.  Some people prefer to `.gitignore` this file, it is optional for team repos to ignore or commit their own `<REPO-NAME>.Rproj` file.
