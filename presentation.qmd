## Reservoirs

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| message: false

library(sf)
library(leaflet)
sites <- suppressMessages(sf::st_read("sites.json"))
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 10
#| message: false

leaflet() %>%
  setView(lat = 37.2, lng = -80.35, zoom= 10) %>%
  addTiles(group="OSM") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group="Imagery") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldTopoMap, group="Topo Map") %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups=c('Imagery','OSM', 'Topo Map')) |> 
  addMarkers(data  = sites, popup=~as.character(site_id), group = ~as.character(Partner), clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

## Assignment

The assignment is designed to help you review R tidyverse skills that have been introduced to prior to the course.

-   Accept (e.g. fork) assignment
-   Clone your accepted assignment repo to your computer
-   Work on assignment (many commits)
-   Push assignment to GitHub (many times - this a backup)
-   Final render of document to HTML
-   Commit and push HTML to GitHub
-   Upload HTML to Canvas
